These creatures often lie dormant, waiting for the scent of blood or movement to awaken them.",

    "Lash out with vine-like tendrils strong enough to crush bones and coated in a paralytic toxin.",
    "Their digestive fluids are highly acidic and can dissolve flesh and bone within minutes.",
    "Emit a sweet, floral scent that lures prey into their reach."

  "danger_level": "High. Incredibly dangerous due to their stealth and strength, and they can easily ambush even experienced fae or Vyr'Zal warriors.",
