  "description": "Frost Wyrms are enormous, serpentine dragons covered in scales made of ice and frost, coiling around the highest peaks. Their eyes glow with a pale blue light, and their breath is a freezing mist that crystallizes anything it touches. These creatures can blend into the snow, making them nearly invisible against the icy terrain.",
  "abilities": [
    "Exhale freezing winds capable of turning entire groups to ice.",
    "Summon blizzards to obscure their movements and launch sharp ice shards from their tails.",
    "Their scales are nearly impervious to most weapons."
