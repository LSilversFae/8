                            "role": "Caelirion was not born of cosmic chaos like the others, but of choice. He is the failsafe of the cosmos—the flame that harmonizes all others. His existence is a convergence of divine, fae, and dragonic bloodlines, destined to either mend the fractured weave of creation or bring about its quiet undoing."

                        "Veilwalk": "Surpassing standard teleportation, Veilwalk lets Caelirion phase through the interstitial spaces between realms—time, shadow, memory, and light—without leaving a trace. While others use gates or spells to shift realms, he simply exists on multiple planes simultaneously.",

It burns neither hot nor cold but reveals the true nature of anything it touches—exposing lies, banishing glamours, and unraveling enchantments. It can ignite divine weapons, purge corrupted relics, or silence eldritch horrors.",
                        "Axis Pulse": "A cosmic resonance Caelirion can emit from his core, synchronizing ley lines, healing rifts between realms, or disintegrating chaotic nodes. When unleashed in full force, it resonates across dimensions, resetting unstable magic in a region-wide radius.",

This ability is exhausting and used only in dire moments."

                      "Abyssal Inheritance": "Caelirion is the only being capable of permanently sealing—or becoming—the Abyss. If corrupted, he could surpass even Azrathar."
